#### Carrying weapons

- If you do not have a CHL, you cannot carry any weapons in a park.

- If you have a CHL, you can open or conceal carry firearms in a park, but no other weapons.

#### Use of force

- A person may use physical force upon another person in self-defense or in defending a third person, in defending property, in making an arrest or in preventing an escape.

- If you are arrested while carrying a shield it will likely be confiscated and is unlikely to be recoverable.

- Shields are best used in large groups where carriers can abandon them if needed.

- A common tactic that can used disable someone with a shield is to grip the shield by the lower lip and then flip it upwards to towards the carrier to topple them backwards.
