# Guides

The Portland Protest Guide and Protestor Handbook both have the same core information, but the Portland guide contains specific laws, maps, and other details that would not be relevant to protestors outside Portland, OR city limits. PDF versions of these guides as well as resources, like alternatives to calling the cops, are also available for download.
