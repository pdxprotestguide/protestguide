# Guides

The Portland Guide and Protestor Handbook both have the same core information, but the Portland Guide contains specific laws, maps, and other details that would not be relevant to protestors outside Portland, OR city limits. Additional downloadable resources, like alternatives for calling the cops, can be accessed via our link tree by clicking the Other Resources button below.
