# Because Indigenous Lives and Land Matter
## Today. Tomorrow. Always.

We respectfully acknowledge that Portland, OR is the traditional homelands of a diverse array of indigenous tribes and bands. Multnomah county rests on traditional village sites of the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, bands of Chinook, Tualatin, Kalapuya, Molalla, and many other Tibes who made thieir home along the Columbia River, and which is now home to a vibrant native community representing over 400 different tribal nations.

We recognize Indigenous peoples as the traditional stewards of this and acknowledge the enduring relationship between the land and the people since time immemorial.

It is also important to move beyond acknowledgement as we reflect on own history that brought us to this place. We are all responsible for understanding the history of colonization and genocide of Indigenous people, and to commit to learning, building relationships, and taking action to support indigenous sovereignty, priorities, and actions.
