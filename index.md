# Because Black Lives Matter
## Today. Tomorrow. Always.

Know your rights. They are some of your tools to create leverage against systems of oppression. Know them so that when they are violated, you can leverage them even harder.

This guide is intended to be a general resource for those protesting in various states and cities. It contains:
- Information on protestorâ€™s rights, discussion of the risks of protesting, and tips for staying safe
- Short write-ups on current law enforcement procedures, tactics, and munitions
- Suggestions for familiarizing yourself with the state and city laws that may be most applicable to protestors, and more

This guide is by no means exhaustive, but a primer for those who are new to protesting as well as a helpful reference sheet for those who have been on the ground before or since the murder of George Floyd. 

Please share this guide where you live to help build and strengthen your local protest community. The more people know about their rights, the more likely they will be to attend a protest. The more communities there are protesting and getting involved, the more able we are to affect change.

Stay sexy, stay safe, and stay dangerous. Be water. Get in good and necessary trouble for the things you believe in.
