# Protesters’ Rights

_The information in this section is collected from the [ACLU Protesters’ Rights page](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights/)._

The First Amendment protects your right to assemble and express your views through protest. However, police and other government officials are allowed to place certain narrow restrictions on the exercise of speech rights. Make sure you’re prepared by brushing up on your rights before heading out into the streets.

### Your rights

- Your rights are strongest in what are known as “traditional public forums,” such as streets, sidewalks, and parks. You also likely have the right to speak out on other public property, like plazas in front of government buildings, as long as you are not blocking access to the government building or interfering with other purposes the  property was designed for.

- Private property owners can set rules for speech on their property. The government may not restrict your speech if it is taking place on your own property or with the consent of the property owner.

- Counterprotesters also have free speech rights. Police must treat protesters and counterprotesters equally. Police are permitted to keep antagonistic groups separated but should allow them to be within sight and sound of one another.

- When you are lawfully present in any public space, you have the right to photograph anything in plain view, including federal buildings and the police. On private property, the owner may set rules related to photography or video. Recording the acts of fellow protestors that could incriminate them should be avoided at all costs. Avoid recording faces, identifying characteristics, unique clothing, and license plates.

- You don’t need a permit to march in the streets or on sidewalks, as long as marchers don’t obstruct car or pedestrian traffic. If you don’t have a permit, police officers can ask you to move to the side of a street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons.

- Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, nor may they delete data under any circumstances. However, they may order citizens to cease activities that are truly interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations

- If you are videotaping, be aware that there is an important legal distinction between a visual photographic record (fully protected) and the audio portion of a videotape, which some states have tried to regulate under state wiretapping laws. In Oregon, you must explicitly state to those whose conversations you are recording that they are being recorded. However this doesn’t apply to police while they are performing official duties, you are in a place you are lawfully allowed to be, and your recording device is in plain view.

### If you believe your rights have been violated

- When you can, write down everything you remember, including the officers’ badge and patrol car numbers and the agency they work for.

- Get contact information from witnesses.

- Take photographs of any injuries and keep any documentation from medical treatment.

- Once you have all of this information, you can file a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.

### If the police issues an order to disperse the protest

- Shutting down a protest through a dispersal order must be law enforcement’s last resort. Police may not break up a gathering unless there is a clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or other immediate threat to public safety.

- If officers issue a dispersal order, they must provide a reasonable opportunity to comply, including sufficient time and a clear, unobstructed exit path.

- Individuals must receive clear and detailed notice of a dispersal order, including how much time they have to disperse, the consequences of failing to disperse, and what clear exit route they can follow, before they may be arrested or charged with any crime.

# In Case of Arrest

_The information in this section is collected from the [ACLU Protesters’ Rights page](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights/), The Black Panther Party Pocket Lawyer pamphlet, and first hand accounts of local Portland protesters._


### Before you go out

- Make an assessment of the risk level of arrest for that protest event; know that bringing things like weapons or body armor could increase the likelihood of arrest or criminal charges.

- Memorize, or write on your body with sharpie, the number of a lawyer you can call in case of arrest, such as the local chapter of the National Lawyer’s Guild. It is recommend to write this somewhere other than your arms or hands as officers may force you to wash it off while in custody.

- #### [**Portland NLG Jail Support: 971-247-1072**](portlandnlg.org)

- Ask someone you trust who will not be attending the protest to be an emergency contact. This person should know:
    - Your full legal name
    - How to check local arrest databases
        - Multnomah County: [http://www.mcso.us/PAID/](http://www.mcso.us/PAID/)
    - Who to call in case of arrest, such as a lawyer, partner, or family member
    - Any important needs in case of arrest, like medication

- Know that protest related arrests do not always occur at the event itself. Warrants can be issued after the fact and may not be executed for weeks or months after a specific protest.

### Your rights

- Stay calm. Make sure to keep your hands visible. Don’t argue, resist, or obstruct the police, even if you believe they are violating your rights. Point out that you are not disrupting anyone else’s activity and that the First Amendment protects your actions.

- If a police officer is not in uniform, ask them to show identification. They have no authority over you unless properly identified. Beware of persons posing as police officers. Always get a badge number and name.

- Ask if you are free to leave. If the officer says yes, calmly walk away.

- If you are under arrest, you have a right to ask why. Otherwise, say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don’t say anything or sign anything without a lawyer.

- You have the right to make a local phone call, and if you’re calling your lawyer, police are not allowed to listen.

- You never have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings. If you do explicitly consent, it can affect you later in court.

- Police may “pat down” your clothing if they suspect you have a weapon and may search you after an arrest.

- Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, nor may they delete data under any circumstances. However, they may order citizens to cease activities that are truly interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations. Despite it being an illegal action, police may still try to search your phone if it is unlocked or attempt to use your fingerprint to unlock it if this feature is enabled.

- Police have no right to search your car or your home unless they have a search warrant, probable cause, or your consent. They may conduct no exploratory search, that is, one for evidence of a crime generally or for evidence of a crime unconnected with the one you are being questioned about. Thus, a stop for an automobile violation does not give the police the right to search the automobile. You are not required to consent to a search; therefore, you should not consent and should state clearly and unequivocally that you do not consent, in front of witnesses if possible. If you do not consent, the police will have the burden in court of showing probable cause.

		
### While in Custody

- Police may or may not tell you that you are under arrest before physically grabbing and arresting you. Officers will likely be forceful with you.

- If you are wearing a backpack or other similar item, it will likely be cut off you while you are being held down during the arrest. You will be handcuffed or zip tied.

- All items on your person will be searched and bagged before you are put in a police vehicle with anyone else being arrested.

- Most people arrested in Portland city limits will be detained at the Justice Center downtown.

- Do not engage in “friendly” conversation with officers on the way to or at the station. Once you are arrested there is little likelihood that anything you say will get you released.

- You will be interviewed in a separate room as part of your arrest. Interviews vary and may be conducted by a group of officers or just one or two. Police should read you your rights before the interview process has started. It is in your best interest to exercise your right to remain silent during the interview. Tell police, **“I choose to remain silent. I would like to speak with a lawyer.”**

- After being interviewed you will be taken to a waiting room where they will remove belts and shoelaces and give you flip flops if you’re wearing steel-toed boots. This is where you will be fingerprinted and photographed. You should also be asked if you would like to receive first aid treatment in case you were injured during your arrest.

- In the waiting area you will also be allowed to make a call. It is recommended that you call the **[Portland National Lawyer’s Guild (NLG)](portlandnlg.org) jail support line (971-247-1072)**, or contact someone who can call them for you.

- Most people report being in custody for about 8 hours. The police must bring you into court or release you within 48 hours after your arrest, unless the time ends on a weekend or a holiday, and they must bring you before a judge the first day court is in session.

- A second interview will be required to determine your bail. If you refuse to give police information such as your legal name and address you may not be released on bail.

- You must be allowed to post bail in most cases, but you must be able to pay the bail bondsmen’s fee. If you cannot pay the fee, you may ask the judge to release you from custody without bail or to lower your bail, but they do not have to do so.

- As part of your release you will need to sign a form acknowledging your arraignment date and that you received any property that you are able to recover.

- Police will likely will hold onto your keys, wallet, glasses, phone, and other essential items until a later date. Make a note of when you will be able to recover this property and have a plan for how to get home, into your home, into your vehicle, and how to contact people if the police hold onto these items for up to several days.

- Jail support teams will be waiting for you outside of the Justice Center, to be a source of comfort and to help you with any logistical issues you might have after your arrest.

- If you know that there is a warrant for your arrest or that arrest is very likely, consider what clothing you are wearing at the time as many people report feeling cold.

### If you believe your rights have been violated

- When you can, write down everything you remember, including the officers’ badge and patrol car numbers and the agency they work for.

- Get contact information from witnesses.

- Take photographs of any injuries and keep any documentation from medical treatment.

- Once you have all of this information, you can file a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.

# Basic First Aid

_The information in this section has been gathered from on the ground experience with advice from local medics._

### Local medic groups

Local medic groups are present at most protest events. These are groups of protesters who are specifically trained and equipped to deal with protest-related injuries. Members of these groups are a mix of medical professionals, medical students, emergency responders, and others who have received specific first aid training. When in doubt, find a medic or medical professional before attempting to treat an injury.

Medics on the ground are marked with a red cross, usually created from tape, on their clothing, backpack, or helmet. To get medical attention for someone try yelling “Medic!” and waving your hands to indicate where the medic is needed. If you are boosting a call for a medic to the larger crowd include a location if possible. For example, “Medic! Front of march!” or “Medic! 4th and Main!”


### Suggested first aid supplies

Consider taking basic first aid supplies with you as part of your standard protest gear. This may include:

- Band-Aids and Neosporin for common cuts and scrapes

- Pain relievers like Tylenol or Ibuprofen

- Extra bottle of water or saline solution to use as an eye wash in case of tear gas or pepper spray exposure

- Disposable gloves to safely assist others with bandages or eyewashes

- Extras masks or face coverings in case one is soiled or exposed to an irritant

- Medical allergy ID bracelet or something similar in case you are severely injured and are not able to communicate with medics before receiving treatment


### Individual first aid kits (IFAKs)

It is recommended that protestors carry an IFAK with them at all events, even if it seems low risk. These are more robust first aid kits designed to help first responders treat traumatic injuries, such as a gunshot wound or major bleeding, and usually contain supplies like tourniquets and chest seals. These kits are called “individual” because they are made to be used on the person who is carrying the kit by first responders and contain limited supplies. IFAKs usually come in small pouches that can be attached to a larger bag or carrying rig for quick access. The pouches are often marked by small velcro patches that may have a red cross or say things like “Bleeding Control.”

If you have not been trained on how to use a particular item in an IFAK, find a medic or medical professional before attempting to treat an injury. Your local medic group or Red Cross may offer training sessions on how to administer first aid for more severe injuries. Refresh this knowledge often. If you need help funding or sourcing an IFAK there may be local mutual aid groups that can help.


### What to do if you suffer a minor injury

- Stay calm. Tear gas exposure can be particularly disorienting and cause panic. Know that this is a temporary experience.

- Move to safe location away from the crowd and any irritants.

- Assess your injuries and call for a medic if needed. A friend may also be able to help you if they feel comfortable doing so.

- Apply first aid like bandages, eye wash, or pain medication.

- Rest. Our bodies are flooded with various hormones after an injury that can mask additional injuries or symptoms.

- Assess how you feel and wether or not you should continue protesting. Find a safe way home or to a medical professional if necessary.


### What to do if someone else suffers a severe injury

- Stay calm. Witnessing someone being severely injured can be scary and can cause a fight-flight-freeze response.

- If you are not able to help move away from the area to clear a path for others. 

- Call for a medic and alert emergency services by calling 911.

- **Do not move the injured person.** This could cause further injury and should be left to those with the proper medical training. If you must move someone because there is a greater risk of injury from staying in the current location (from munitions, a running crowd, etc) work with others and make sure that the head and neck are supported at all times.

- If someone is bleeding heavily, apply pressure to the wound to help prevent blood loss until a medic can relieve you. Once medics are onsite, let them provide assessment and treatment. In most cases, the best thing you can do for someone is help them get care by a trained responder.

- Help keep the area clear for medics and emergency responders.

- Arrange transport to a hospital. Depending on the nature and location of the protest ambulance services may have difficulty responding immediately. Evac cars are often designated ahead of time in case of an emergency. Medics, motorcade, and security members are most likely to know how to alert an evac vehicle that they are needed. **If possible, an ambulance should be the first choice of transportation.**

# Common Police Tactics

_The information in this section has been gathered from on the ground experience as well as the Chemical Weapons Research Consortium (https://www.chemicalweaponsresearch.com/), a local Portland group focused on understanding the impact of chemical weapons used by law enforcement on humans and the environment._

Law enforcement responses vary widely from department to department. City police departments often respond very differently to situations than suburban or rural police departments, especially depending on the frequency and intensity of events that have happened within their jurisdiction. However, they all pull from the same playbook and utilize similar strategies.

### Kettling

Kettling is a trap technique where law enforcement officers will strategically herd a crowd of protestors down streets into a dead end or to an area where there are other law enforcement officers (LEOs) staged and ready to make mass arrests.

You can avoid kettling by being aware of your surroundings, the streets you are traveling, and how officers are moving. Don’t Get Kettled maps have been made for several common protest locations and show the safest routes that allow multiple options for egress. See the Maps section for Don’t Get Kettled maps for common Portland protest locations.

On rare occasions, PPB has completely surrounded crowds to prevent them from moving or to detain or arrest protestors. In other situations, police have blocked the path of the crowd in only one direction in attempts to prevent them from reaching a specific destination.

Note that if you are kettled by police and are detained, but not arrested, you are not required to show your ID or give other information. However, if you refuse to give this information you may be more likely to be arrested.

### Impact munitions

Law enforcement often uses various types of impact munitions as a legal means of violence to disperse protestors. These munitions may include powder balls, rubber bullets, rubber buckshot, bean bags, FN303 marking rounds, or plastic batons. The rubber buckshot and FN303 marking rounds are hybrid chemical weapons. The rubber buckshot is sometimes coated in CS (see section C for more detailed information on chemical weapon usage). The FN303 marking rounds contain bismuth shards, which can lead to heavy metal toxicity.

These munitions have killed and severely injured protestors, especially when directed at protestors' heads. Impact munitions can also cause broken bones, cuts, and severe
bruising. If you are attending an event where munitions are likely to be used consider wearing or bringing a helmet, motorcycle armor and goggles (not swim goggles), shields, and/or umbrellas.
Chemical Weapons

The use of chemical weapons on human beings in the setting of warfare has been outlawed under many different political bodies. Abraham Lincoln outlawed chemical weapon usage in American warfare in 1863, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 classified chemical warfare as a war crime, as did the Geneva Conventions of 1925. For domestic use however, these chemical weapons are still a legal option by many cities to use as a form of riot control and crowd dispersal. In Portland, as of 2021, chemical weapons are a legal form of riot control. None of the following chemical weapons are permitted for use in warfare. 


#### Tear gas

Tear gasses and smokes are used to temporarily cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Federal and local LEOs both deploy tear gas.

Exposure to tear gas can make it difficult for you to see and make you feel like you’re unable to breathe normally, which can cause confusion, panic, and psychological distress in addition to intense physical pain. Covering your eyes with goggles, wearing long sleeves and pants, and using a respirator with acid/vapor rated filters or gas masks are the best strategies to avoid debilitating exposure.

Tear gasses are the chemical compounds CS, OC, and PAVA. 

- **CS** has been used in gas canister form, aerosol spray, and as a powder coating on rubber buckshot impact munitions.

- **OC** is used in impact chemical weapon hybrids like powder form on foam bullet impact munitions and powder balls as well as in gas canister and aerosol spray.  

- **PAVA** is commonly used in impact chemical weapon hybrids such as powder balls and FN303 marking rounds. While it is available as an aerosol spray as well, it has not been proved to have been used in this form in Portland.


#### Smokes

While "Saf Smoke" incendiary devices are labeled safer than tear gasses, they include heavy metals that can lead to heavy metal toxicity. These are not safer to inhale and are still harmful.

HC Smoke Grenades

Federal agents from DHS and BORTAC have deployed HC grenades in 2020 and 2021 in the downtown parks Lownsdale and Chapman Squares and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the South Waterfront neighborhood. HC produces a Zinc Chloride (ZnCl2) gas, which can be deadly when inhaled and cause an illness called metal fume fever. The symptoms of metal fume fever include flu-like symptoms, extreme prolonged nausea and loss of appetite, dizziness, coughing, fatigue, and joint pain. More severe symptoms suggest a lethal heavy metal toxicity and one should seek medical help ASAP. 

Unfortunately there is little short of a closed breathing apparatus and full body Tyvek for personal protection again HC grenades.


#### Treating Exposure to Tear Gas and other irritants

- Rinse eyes with plain water or saline while blinking to restore vision.

- Wash any exposed skin with soap and water.

- Carefully remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible. Avoid pulling clothing over your head, which could further irritate your eyes, nose, and mouth. Shirts may need to be cut off instead.

- Contaminated clothing and other items should be double bagged and handled with care until they can be laundered. Do not touch contaminated items with your bare hands. Use gloves, tongs, or other tools during bagging and disposal.

# Relevant Laws

_This section covers local and state laws most relevant to those protesting in Portland, OR. See Full Legal Codes section for links to the full definition of each law referenced here._

### Firearms

#### **Oregon state gun laws take precedent over Portland city gun laws**

#### Oregon state law

- If you do not have a conceal carry permit (CHL), you can open carry an unloaded weapon and have loaded magazines on your person--which is in contradiction to Portland gun laws.

#### Portland city law

- Firearms cannot be brought into a courthouse or on federal property, even if you have a conceal carry permit.

- If you have an Oregon conceal carry permit (CHL): you can open or conceal carry a loaded firearm and loaded magazines in a public space, including in a vehicle and on public streets. You can also open or conceal carry an unloaded firearm.

- If you do not have an Oregon conceal carry permit: you cannot have a loaded firearm or loaded magazine in a public space, including in a vehicle and on public streets. You can open carry unloaded firearms and magazines.

- You cannot point an empty or loaded gun at another person within range of the firearm unless in self-defense.

- You cannot fire a gun in Portland with a few exceptions, including defense of property or another person.

- You cannot have armor piercing handgun ammunition.

- You do not have to tell a police officer you are carrying a weapon unless they ask.

### Other weapons

#### Knives

-  Oregon law does not restrict the ownership of any type of knife for those who have not been convicted of a felony. It is legal to own a dirk, dagger, or other stabbing knife, Bowie knife, switchblade or other automatic knife, ballistic knife, gravity knife, Balisong, or butterfly knife and Balisong trainer, and a stiletto.

- If you have not been convicted of a felony: you can have and open carry a dirk, dagger, or other stabbing knife, Bowie knife, switchblade or other automatic knife, ballistic knife, gravity knife, Balisong, or butterfly knife and Balisong trainer, and a stiletto. The only knife you can conceal carry is a pocketknife.

- If you have been convicted of a felony: you may not own a knife with a blade that projects or swings into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force. You may not open or conceal carry a dirk, dagger, or stiletto. 

#### Pepper spray

- Pepper spray is legal to buy/carry/use/ship to Oregon

- Must be a minimum of 18 years old

- Cannot have any convicted felonies on record

- For self defense purposes only

- Don’t spray cops, EMTs, firefighters, parole officers, etc.

- In the state of Oregon, it is perfectly legal to carry pepper spray or an electrical stun gun; however, a person can be charged with a crime for recklessly discharging either of these items against another person.

### Self defense & property defense

#### Carrying weapons

- If you do not have a CHL, you cannot carry any weapons in a park.

- If you have a CHL, you can open or conceal carry firearms in a park, but no other weapons.

- You cannot bring firearms or knives onto a Portland streetcar. Where you cannot be prohibited from carrying a weapon, it must at least be concealed.

#### Use of force

- A person may use physical force upon another person in self-defense or in defending a third person, in defending property, in making an arrest or in preventing an escape.

- Be on the lookout if an aggressor tells you to talk to their accomplice during a heated interaction: if things escalate between you and the accomplice the aggressor can claim that use of force was justified because they feared for their accomplice’s safety.

#### Body armor

- If you have not been convicted of a felony or violent misdemeanor: you can legally own and wear body armor.

- If you have been convicted of a felony or violent misdemeanor: you cannot legally own or wear body armor.

- It is illegal to possess body armor if you are committing a felony or violent misdemeanor while also possessing a deadly weapon.

#### Shields

- Shields are not illegal if covered with padding and used as defense items

- Having a shield may mean you are more likely to be target by police. Law enforcement has claimed that they are weapons and use this to justify arrest.

- If you are arrested while carrying a shield it will likely be confiscated and is unlikely to be recoverable.

- Shields are best used in large groups where carriers can abandon them if needed.

- A common tactic that can used disable someone with a shield is to grip the shield by the lower lip and then flip it upwards to towards the carrier to topple them backwards.

### Doxing

There are currently no laws that limit or punish the intentional dissemination of someone’s personal information online without the persons consent and with the intention to harass, humiliate or injure that person, but two bills are currently under consideration for the 2021 legislative session. If the bills become law doxing will become a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a fine of $6,250. If the person posting information has a prior conviction they could be charged with a Class C felony instead.

### Trespassing & Vandalism

#### Criminal mischief

- Criminal mischief covers the damage of property “with the intent to cause substantial inconvenience to the owner or someone else.”

- Depending on what is damaged, its value, and how it is damaged, criminal mischief may be a misdemeanor punishable by fine and up to 1 year in prison or a Class C felony punishable by fine and up to 5 years in prison.

- Doing more than $750 of damage, use of an explosive, and damaging or interfering with a public utilities or telecommunications are among are among criteria for a felony charge.

#### Arson and burning

- You can be charged with arson if you set a fire that damages protected property, such as buildings, endangers another person, or injures another person, firefighter, or law enforcement officer.

- Arson charges are felonies with prison sentences of up to 5 or 20 years depending on severity

- Reckless burning includes any fire or explosion that damages property. This is a Class A misdemeanor punishable with up to 1 year in prison.

#### Graffiti

This also goes for possessing a graffiti implement with intent to use it for creating graffiti. Possession will get you a fine and up to 50 hours of community service that needs to be completed within six months.

- Portland law defines graffiti as: Any unauthorized markings of paint, ink, chalk, dye or other similar substance which is visible from premises open to the public, and that have been placed upon any real or personal property such as buildings, fences, structures, or the unauthorized etching or scratching of such described surfaces where the markings are visible from premises open to the public, such as public rights of way or other publicly owned property.


#### Trespassing

- Trespassing with or without a firearm is a misdemeanor.

### Other common violations filed against protesters

#### Disorderly conduct

- Disorderly conduct in the second degree is the most commonly cited crime for protestors, as it is a nebulous catch-all that criminalizes most protest-related activities. It is a misdemeanor.

#### Resisting arrest

- You cannot legally resist arrest by someone who is law enforcement or appears to be law enforcement, whether or not the arrest is lawful.

#### Rioting

- A riot is defined as five or more people intentionally engaging in “tumultuous and violent conduct,” and is a felony.
