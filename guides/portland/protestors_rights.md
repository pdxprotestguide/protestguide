# Protesters’ Rights

_The information in this section is collected from the [ACLU Protesters’ Rights page](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights/)._

The First Amendment protects your right to assemble and express your views through protest. However, police and other government officials are allowed to place certain narrow restrictions on the exercise of speech rights. Make sure you’re prepared by brushing up on your rights before heading out into the streets.

### Your rights as a protestor

- Your rights are strongest in what are known as “traditional public forums,” such as streets, sidewalks, and parks. You also likely have the right to speak out on other public property, like plazas in front of government buildings, as long as you are not blocking access to the government building or interfering with other purposes the  property was designed for.

- Private property owners can set rules for speech on their property. The government may not restrict your speech if it is taking place on your own property or with the consent of the property owner.

- Counterprotesters also have free speech rights. Police must treat protesters and counterprotesters equally. Police are permitted to keep antagonistic groups separated but should allow them to be within sight and sound of one another.

- When you are lawfully present in any public space, you have the right to photograph anything in plain view, including federal buildings and the police. On private property, the owner may set rules related to photography or video. Recording the acts of fellow protestors that could incriminate them should be avoided at all costs. Avoid recording faces, identifying characteristics, unique clothing, and license plates.

- You don’t need a permit to march in the streets or on sidewalks, as long as marchers don’t obstruct car or pedestrian traffic. If you don’t have a permit, police officers can ask you to move to the side of a street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons.

- Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, nor may they delete data under any circumstances. However, they may order citizens to cease activities that are truly interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations

- If you are videotaping, be aware that there is an important legal distinction between a visual photographic record (fully protected) and the audio portion of a videotape, which some states have tried to regulate under state wiretapping laws. In Oregon, you must explicitly state to those whose conversations you are recording that they are being recorded. However this doesn’t apply to police while they are performing official duties, you are in a place you are lawfully allowed to be, and your recording device is in plain view.

### What to do if you believe your rights have been violated

- When you can, write down everything you remember, including the officers’ badge and patrol car numbers and the agency they work for.

- Get contact information from witnesses.

- Take photographs of any injuries and keep any documentation from medical treatment.

- Once you have all of this information, you can file a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.

### What to do if the police issues an order to disperse the protest

- Shutting down a protest through a dispersal order must be law enforcement’s last resort. Police may not break up a gathering unless there is a clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or other immediate threat to public safety.

- If officers issue a dispersal order, they must provide a reasonable opportunity to comply, including sufficient time and a clear, unobstructed exit path.

- Individuals must receive clear and detailed notice of a dispersal order, including how much time they have to disperse, the consequences of failing to disperse, and what clear exit route they can follow, before they may be arrested or charged with any crime.
