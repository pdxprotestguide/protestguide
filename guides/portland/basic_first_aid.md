# Basic First Aid

_The information in this section has been gathered from on the ground experience with advice from local medics._

### Local medic groups

Local medic groups are present at most protest events. These are groups of protesters who are specifically trained and equipped to deal with protest-related injuries. Members of these groups are a mix of medical professionals, medical students, emergency responders, and others who have received specific first aid training. When in doubt, find a medic or medical professional before attempting to treat an injury.

Medics on the ground are marked with a red cross, usually created from tape, on their clothing, backpack, or helmet. To get medical attention for someone try yelling “Medic!” and waving your hands to indicate where the medic is needed. If you are boosting a call for a medic to the larger crowd include a location if possible. For example, “Medic! Front of march!” or “Medic! 4th and Main!”


### Suggested first aid supplies

Consider taking basic first aid supplies with you as part of your standard protest gear. This may include:

- Band-Aids and Neosporin for common cuts and scrapes

- Pain relievers like Tylenol or Ibuprofen

- Extra bottle of water or saline solution to use as an eye wash in case of tear gas or pepper spray exposure

- Disposable gloves to safely assist others with bandages or eyewashes

- Extras masks or face coverings in case one is soiled or exposed to an irritant

- Medical allergy ID bracelet or something similar in case you are severely injured and are not able to communicate with medics before receiving treatment


### Individual first aid kits (IFAKs)

It is recommended that protestors carry an IFAK with them at all events, even if it seems low risk. These are more robust first aid kits designed to help first responders treat traumatic injuries, such as a gunshot wound or major bleeding, and usually contain supplies like tourniquets and chest seals. These kits are called “individual” because they are made to be used on the person who is carrying the kit by first responders and contain limited supplies. IFAKs usually come in small pouches that can be attached to a larger bag or carrying rig for quick access. The pouches are often marked by small velcro patches that may have a red cross or say things like “Bleeding Control.”

If you have not been trained on how to use a particular item in an IFAK, find a medic or medical professional before attempting to treat an injury. Your local medic group or Red Cross may offer training sessions on how to administer first aid for more severe injuries. Refresh this knowledge often. If you need help funding or sourcing an IFAK there may be local mutual aid groups that can help.


### What to do if you suffer a minor injury

- Stay calm. Tear gas exposure can be particularly disorienting and cause panic. Know that this is a temporary experience.

- Move to safe location away from the crowd and any irritants.

- Assess your injuries and call for a medic if needed. A friend may also be able to help you if they feel comfortable doing so.

- Apply first aid like bandages, eye wash, or pain medication.

- Rest. Our bodies are flooded with various hormones after an injury that can mask additional injuries or symptoms.

- Assess how you feel and wether or not you should continue protesting. Find a safe way home or to a medical professional if necessary.


### What to do if someone else suffers a severe injury

- Stay calm. Witnessing someone being severely injured can be scary and can cause a fight-flight-freeze response.

- If you are not able to help move away from the area to clear a path for others. 

- Call for a medic and alert emergency services by calling 911.

- **Do not move the injured person.** This could cause further injury and should be left to those with the proper medical training. If you must move someone because there is a greater risk of injury from staying in the current location (from munitions, a running crowd, etc) work with others and make sure that the head and neck are supported at all times.

- If someone is bleeding heavily, apply pressure to the wound to help prevent blood loss until a medic can relieve you. Once medics are onsite, let them provide assessment and treatment. In most cases, the best thing you can do for someone is help them get care by a trained responder.

- Help keep the area clear for medics and emergency responders.

- Arrange transport to a hospital. Depending on the nature and location of the protest ambulance services may have difficulty responding immediately. Evac cars are often designated ahead of time in case of an emergency. Medics, motorcade, and security members are most likely to know how to alert an evac vehicle that they are needed. **If possible, an ambulance should be the first choice of transportation.**
